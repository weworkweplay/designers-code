Sounds like now is a good time to go deep into HTML/CSS again. What would be the first thing to learn?  
**T**: Positioning elements, once you understand how to put things on your screen the way you want, you'll have that warm and fuzzy feeling inside that we all secretly yearn for ;). Can you send me a very simple design of some elements you want to position on a site?  
**V**: How about this? I remember vertical position was always a fun one.
